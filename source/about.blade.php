            Education
        </h3>

        <p class="text-lg | mb-8">
            I have a <strong>Bachelor Degree in System and network administration</strong> and a <strong>Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg | mb-24">
            The former was achieve in a Belgian university in 2015, where the later was the result of a year in <strong>Ireland (in Athlone)</strong> with the Erasmus program.
        </p>

            Experience
        </h3>

        <p class="text-lg | mb-8">
            My first job was as a <strong>Cloud Backend Engineer</strong>, which is just a fancy title to hide the fact that I was a Fullstack Developer. I worked for a telecom company that specialized in Unified Communication.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg | mb-8">
            I learned <strong>AngularJS</strong> (1.4) and worked on their <strong>legacy PHP</strong> (5.3 with custom framework).
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg | mb-8">
            After a year I quit to join a small startup as a <strong>Web Developer</strong>. I worked on their SaaS solution, a task management tool. We build it using <strong>Laravel</strong> and <strong>VueJS</strong>. When my contract ended, I decided not to continue working there due to difference of opinion with the CEO.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg | mb-8">
            I finally join Altavia Act* as a <strong>Back-end Developer</strong>. I've been working there for over a year now (I joined in March 2017). In addition to being the only back-end developer, I'm also handling the Ops side of our work (deploiments and server maintenance) and I am Code Owner for all new projects.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg | mb-24">
            My responsabilities are mainly to deliver clean, optimized, tested and functionnal <strong>Laravel</strong> based products. As Code Owner I review all commits and ensure that the code we deliver is matching our standards.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-normal text-default | mb-6">
            Outside of work
        </h3>

        <p class="text-lg | mb-8">
            In my personal time I like to read (mostly Heroic Fantasy books) and play video games. I also enjoy boardgames and table tob RPGs (both as player and dungeon master).
        </p>

        <p class="text-blue text-xl md:text-lg | mb-24">
            In 2017 I challenged myself to run 365km during the whole year. I started seriously to run around July, and in 4 month I achieved that goal. In October 2017 I ran the <em>Brussels Half-Marathon</em> and the <em>20km des Ardennes</em> and I'm currently training (lazely) for the <em>2018 Brussels Marathon</em>.
