I think that I don't need to tell you what happened in 2020. We are all aware of what a shitty year it was for everyone. I remember that last year I told myself to not make objectives because something was going to fuck shit up. And boy I wasn't prepare for this. It's going to be a shorter one that previous year because I don't want to spend hours writing everything in details. I want to provide some insight in my year, but I'll skip many thing that I'm not ready (mentally) to speak about.

# Work

In 2019 I started working for trivago and moving from Brussels to Leipzig. Last year the team that I'm part of decided to "split" our of trivago to create a whitelabel version of our product to attract a bigger audience. In February trivago announced us that they were closing the Leipzig office and we got offers to move to D端sseldorf (our main office) or lose our job in July.

That was a big hit. We were 20-ish developer in that office and I'm the only one that decided to move. We went from a team of 25+ engineers to 5.

When came the time accept or refuse the offer COVID happended. 

If you don't know trivago it's a metasearch website for hotel (it compares hotels and give you the best prices). Which means that it needs people to travel to make money. With COVID trivago was forced to close 2 more office and lay off tons of people. But that also meant that our plan for the new company was put on hold.

For the next couples of month I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to move to D端sseldorf and keep my job. The answer came end of June. I don't have to tell how stressful these month were as I'm sure that I'm not the only one that was unsure about being able to keep his job or not.

In July I started to look for a new flat in D端sseldorf and to make it simple, I had to hire a lawyer because the management office that handles my flat in Leipzig was trying to screw me over. And the situation is still not resolve despite the fact that I moved out of the flat end of August.

Anyway. One good thing that happened to me this year was the realization that I'm a good developer. I managed to get rid of my imposter syndrom. How? Recruiting. Since we lost multiple member of our team we needed to hire. And boy, reviewing people's code can be very enlighting. I must have reviewed around 50 case studies of "senior" software engineers and 99% of them were just bad. And reading the code of people that are considered senior in their company or have been developers for 10+ years made me realize that I'm good. I've been coding for about 7 years now (5 professionally) and my code is 100% better than anything I saw. This is thanks to the Laravel community that has such high standard in terms of good and readable code.

In October we lost 3 more members of our team and in January another one is leaving. I'm going to be the sole engineer of my team in 2021 :joy: . It's kind of funny. I joined last year in May and I find myself leading this project that people have been working on for 3 years. I have to admit that I really enjoyed being put in this position when the previous "lead" left. I never ask for it, but other people decided that I was the one that had to make decisions regarding tech.

# Home office

I always wanted to try home office properly. I've worked from home once in a while, but it's not the same. And I'm really happy working from home. I'm way more productive and I can ignore people talking to me without feeling bad. I think it's a good thing and I don't see myself going back to an office at the moment.

When I moved to D端sseldorf I made myself a new setup. I can't be more happy about it. You can see picture on my twitter, but I'll add some to the post later. I have an IKEA Bekant standing desk, but I replace the counter top by a wooden kitchen countertop, which makes it way better. I changed so many things (microphone, webcam, lighting, screens) that it's hard to describe in text format to be honest.

# Personal life

I've been pretty much offline this year when it comes to social media. I wasn't in the mood to be honest. I've ignore so many thing and so many people.

Being abroad when a pandemic happen sucks. I'm very close to my family but I was unable to see them in month. In June I got the chance to go back to Belgium to meet with them, but that was it for 2020. My mental health took a bit hit because of that. One big escape from all of this was Dungeon and Dragons. Last year I started to DM a campaign for some colleagues. And this year I played in 2 campaigns, I'm still running mine and I started playing in a new one. This has kept me quite busy and there's nothing better that pretending to be someone else to make you forget how shitty the world is right now.

With the whole work and flat situation that I had to handle I didn't took any holiday in 2020. And at the begining of December I started to burn out. I was unmotivated and stressed all the time. This resulted in me taking the month of December off work to be able to rest before it got out of hand.

# Closing notes

I'm sorry this isn't a great read. 

I'm really not feeling in the mood to write mote. I had a very hard year, like tons of people out there. So much happen, good and bad and disconnecting from everything was a rally good decision.

Take care of your self. Nobody expect 100% from you in these hard times. So, take a break if you need to and wear a mask!
